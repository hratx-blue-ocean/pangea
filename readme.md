# Welcome to Pangaea

Looking to learn a language? Studies show that the best way to learn a language is to have conversations daily. Pangaea facilitates those conversations for you.  Our web application allows users to communicate with native speakers and schedule a meet up, or just chat in real time.

Our team of software engineers was approached by a client who asked us to build what would become the Pangaea web application. We were given feedback throughout and two weeks to initially deploy the application.

We chose a monolithic architecture. Below are links to our documentation to our process, user stories, technology stack, instructions for getting started, our workflow and ticketing approach, and team composition.

# User Stories
## Implement
Based on the request of our client, we defined the following user stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to create an account
- As a user, I want to see other user profiles who speak the language I want to learn
- As a user, I want to chat with other users in real time
- As a user, I want to want to be able to log out
- As a user, I want to be able to use a calendar to log meetup times
- As a user, I want to edit the language I’m interested in
- As a user, I want to set my fluent languages
- As a user, I want to be notified when my username and password are incorrect

# Work Flow and Ticketing
## Work Flow
We followed a Git workflow to ensure work is accomplished in a consistent and productive manner.

## Ticketing
For ticketing and allocation of work, we followed an agile methodology. We created tickets in Trello with six basic states:
- Important Reference Info - Planning and universal information that is commonly referenced
- Back Burner - work that will be tackled in future sprints
- Sprint Plan - work that will be finished in current sprint
- In Progress NOW - what is currently being worked on by each member of the team this sprint
- Staged for merge - complete, but work waiting to be reviewed and merged
- Deployed to production - work has been added to current deployment
